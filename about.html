    <p>Being young and naive, I started to write web pages in the late 1990s. One of them was the first website of the Human Resources Department at Tsinghua University. A benefit of working for HR is that you could see job openings earlier than other people. My wife got her first job at Tsinghua this way.</p>

    <p>As time goes by, I have been always amazed by the evolution of technology. Pursuit of knowledge makes me happy, and I would like to share this happiness with the younger generation.</p>

    <p>Modern web pages are built with HTML for the structure and content, CSS for the styles and presentation, and JavaScript for the dyanmic effects and interactions. This tutorial focuses on HTML and CSS.</p>

    <p>After a brief introduction in chapter 1, we will learn how to construct structures, text, lists, links, images, tables and media with HTML in chapters 2--8. After the basics of CSS in chapter 9, we will learn how to decorate various elements with CSS in chapters 10--14. Chpater 15 presents best pratices of web development, and chapter 16 the tools and resources.</p>
